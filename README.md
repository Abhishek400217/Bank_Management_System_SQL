🏦 Bank Management System — SQL Project

A complete Bank Management System database project built on Oracle Database (tested on Oracle 23ai Free).
It models real-world banking entities — Bank, Branch, Employee, Customer, Account, Loan, Transaction — with a clean schema, constraints, realistic seed data, and a library of practice queries (from simple to complex).

📂 Project Structure

Schema.sql → All CREATE TABLE statements with keys & constraints

Data_Insert_queries.sql → Realistic sample data (INSERT INTO)

queries.sql → Practice queries (Simple → Moderate → Complex: JOIN, Aggregate, Subquery, Window Functions)
